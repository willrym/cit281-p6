## The Good Stuff:
1. Created three classes
2. The first class is the Shape class that served as a base class for the other two classes
3. The second class is the Rectangle class that inherited from Shape class
4. A class that inherited from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class
5. The third class is the Triangle class that also inherited from the Shape class
